# SuperStore_Sales_Dashboard---Sales-Forecasting---PowerBI

This project is a sales dashboard created in Power BI using the SuperStore dataset. It provides insights into sales performance across regions and product categories, and also includes sales forecasting to predict future trends.

I built this dashboard after learning from Rishabh Mishra’s Power BI tutorials, where I understood the core concepts and then customized the visuals and layout in my own way.

Historical sales trend analysis

Forecasting with Power BI’s built-in analytics
